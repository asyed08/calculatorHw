## Population Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a calculation of the dispersion or variation in a set of numbers. If the standard deviation is a small number, it means the data points are close to their average value. If the deviation is large, it means the numbers are spread out, further from the mean or average.

There are two types of standard deviation calculations. Population standard deviation looks at the square root of the variance of the set of numbers. It's used to determine a confidence interval for drawing conclusions (such as accepting or rejecting a hypothesis). A slightly more complex calculation is called sample standard deviation. This is a simple example of how to calculate variance and population standard deviation. First, let's review how to calculate the population standard deviation:


* Calculate the mean (simple average of the numbers).
* For each number: Subtract the mean. Square the result.
* Calculate the mean of those squared differences. This is the variance.
* Take the square root of that to obtain the population standard deviation.

σ = ([Σ(x - u)2]/N)1/2

Where:

* σ is the population standard deviation
* Σ represents the sum or total from 1 to N
* x is an individual value
* u is the average of the population
* N is the total number of the population
