## Variance of Population Proportion

In a population, variance is the average squared deviation from the population mean, as defined by the following formula:

σ2 = Σ ( Xi - μ )2 / N

where σ2 is the population variance, μ is the population mean, Xi is the ith element from the population, and N is the number of elements in the population.

Observations from a simple random sample can be used to estimate the variance of a population. For this purpose, sample variance is defined by slightly different formula, and uses a slightly different notation:

s2 = Σ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 )

where s2 is the sample variance, x is the sample mean, xi is the ith element from the sample, and n is the number of elements in the sample. Using this formula, the sample variance can be considered an unbiased estimate of the true population variance. Therefore, if you need to estimate an unknown population variance, based on data from a simple random sample, this is the formula to use.
